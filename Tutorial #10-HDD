Cache thrash is caused by an ongoing computer activity that fails to progress due to excessive use of resources or conflicts in the caching system.
FIFO does not prevent this from happening.
Cause high CPU utilization that can cause crashes

Any technique that is regular and repetitive will be prone to trashing.

Random access

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Memory chara of cache: Very fast in terms of access speed
SRAM - fastest (Switches and transistors) (Occupies space - less space for memory cells)
DRAM - slow and need refresh (Switches and capacitors) (slower than transistors)
Flash - finite erase cycles and slow (Non-volatile, diff tech from switches)

User got no control where data is stored. To ensure even life span of the memory cells, every part of the storage device would be used.

NAND Flash Memory

Advantages
- Cheaper by cost per bit
- Nonvolatile storage technology that does not require power to retain data. 
- Higher maximum chip capacity so that flash memory can compete with magnetic storage devices, such as hard disks
- More compact

Cons
- Cannot read random access
- Data accessed a page at a time

- Use as storage memory (eg SD Card, USB thumbdrive)

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
NOR Flash Memory
- Allows random data read by providing address info only
- Supports execute in place (Code can execute directly)
- More transistors so more expensive
- Less compact thaan NAND

- Ue mainly as system memory to store program code (eg mobile phones)

**Flash memory finite because of the material. Non magnetic.

Hybrid solution of using both SSD and hard disk. Hard disk to store some of the larger memory. SSD to store system.

Capacity of HDD001
- 4 surfaces
- 1024 tracks per surface
- 128 sectors per track
- 512 bytes/ sector
4*1024**128*512 = 256 MByte

Note: 
2 to the power of 10 is 1KB
2 to pow of 20 = 1 MB
2 to pow of 30 = 1 GB

Access Time 

HDD Transfer rate
Seek time - time taken for head to get to correct track
Rotational delay - time taken for disk to rotate until read/write head reaches starting position of target
Access time - time from request to time heaad is in position
Transfer time - time to transfer required data after head is positioned

Track to track seek time is 5 millisecond
Rotational speed of 5000RPM

Ts = 5mS
TR = 0.5/RPS
TA = TS+TR

5000/ 60 
TR = 0.5*60/5000 = 6 mS

TA = TS + TR = 5+6 = 11mS

TS is also average seek time

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Time to transfer 4Kbyte file (assume consecutive sectors)

Time for each rotation = 60/5000 = 0.012 s
128*512 = 65536 bytessssssleepy

Access time = 11ms
Transfer time = 4096*(0.012/65536) = 0.00075 = 0.75

**There are different number of sectors for each track, to maximise the linear space


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Time to transfer 4Kbyte file (non-consecutive sectors)

**Possible due to fragmentation
**While defragmenting, ensure power source connected

Time per rot = 0.012s

How many sectors to read 4kb: 4096/512 = 8

Transfer time: 0.012/128 = 93.7 microS 

How long to read 1 sector TA + TT

Total time (8sectors): 8*(TA+TT) = 88.75ms

HDD002 (GOOD) vs HDD001
- More reliable
  - higher MTTF 
- Higher read/write performance
  - higher RPM
   - shorter seek time
- More capacity
  - more heads and sectors per track

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SSD instead of HDD?
No. SSD cost per bit is too high for large storaage. Has finite read/write cycles

**1 head for 1 surface

Memory choice for system and storage memory
- Ultra-thin android tablet with long battery life

System memory: DRAM
- Mem capacity: 1-2GB
- Lower cost than SRAM

Storage memory: NAND Flash
- thinner form factor
- lower power consumption

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Probability that HDD001 still functioning after 1 year
R(t) = e to the power of (-time/MTTF)
time = 1 year = 24*365 = 8760
R(t) = 0.983

Probability of HDD002 still working
R(t) = 0.991

** But this does not mean that HDD001 will definitely spoil before HDD002. MTTF is just a statistical estimation.

Which RAID configuration cannot tolerate a signle disk falilure
- Risk management
RAID lvl 0

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Tolerate 1 disk failure

- RAID lvls 1 and 5
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Can tolerate more than 1 simultaneous disk failure
- RAID lvl 6 (for critical info)

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
** RAID lvl 10
- if 2 hard disks break down on one side, then cannot recover
- cannot be classified under any of the tutorial qsns
